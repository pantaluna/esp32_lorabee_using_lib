## Project Description
This project demonstrates the basic commands to configure the device and to read/write the NVM.

This project demonstrates the basics of using the MJD component "mjd_lorabee" for the popular SODAQ LoraBee board. That board is basically an XBee breakout board that contains a Microchip RN2843A Lora module (note the subversion "A"). The Microchip RN2483A module contains a Semtech SX1276 Lora transceiver chip. It must be used in combination with the Parallax XBee Adapter Board 32403 which breaks out the Xbee pins to breadboard-compatible pins.

Use it to get insights in how to use this component.

Goto the component "components/mjd_lorabee" for documentation, installation, soldering and wiring instructions, data sheets, FAQ, photo's, etc.



## What are the HW SW requirements of the ESP32 MJD Starter Kit?

### Hardware

- A decent ESP development board. I suggest to buy a popular development board with good technical documentation and a significant user base. Examples: [Adafruit HUZZAH32](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3405),  [Espressif ESP32-DevKitC](http://espressif.com/en/products/hardware/esp32-devkitc/overview), [Pycom WiPy](https://pycom.io/hardware/), [Wemos D32](https://wiki.wemos.cc/products:d32:d32).
- The peripherals that are used in the project.
  @tip The README of each component contains a section "Shop Products".
  @example A Bosch BME280 meteo sensor breakout board.

### Software: ESP-IDF v3.2

- A working installation of the **Espressif ESP-IDF *V3.2* development framework**** (detailed instructions @ http://esp-idf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/get-started/index.html).

```
mkdir ~/esp
cd    ~/esp
git clone -b v3.3 --recursive https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf.git esp-idf-v3.2
```

- A C language editor or the Eclipse IDE CDT (instructions also @ http://esp-idf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/get-started/index.html).



## Running the example
- Run `make flash monitor` to build and upload the example to your board and connect to its serial terminal.

## Notes
- Change the logging level of each ESP32 project using `make menuconfig` from "INFO" to "DEBUG" if you want to get more details about the requests and responses that are exchanged using the UART data channel.



## Reference: the ESP32 MJD Starter Kit SDK

Do you also want to create innovative IoT projects that use the ESP32 chip, or ESP32-based modules, of the popular company Espressif? Well, I did and still do. And I hope you do too.

The objective of this well documented Starter Kit is to accelerate the development of your IoT projects for ESP32 hardware using the ESP-IDF framework from Espressif and get inspired what kind of apps you can build for ESP32 using various hardware modules.
